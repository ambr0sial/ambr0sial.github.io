    <p>hi, i'm ambrose, also known as ambrosial!</p>
    <p>i'm an 18yo french trans girl who loves exploring all kinds of odd corners of tech and science</p>
    <p>you'll usually find me digging into astronomy, coding and malware development/analysis</p>
    <br>
    <p>i had multiple people asking the same questions over and over again such as "why do you make malware" or "you do realize putting your malware in public/open-source is dangerous right", so i'm going to be really concise here:</p>
    <p>i think malware, when treated thoughtfully, can be a form of art. it also teaches you about how systems actually behave under pressure</p>
    <p>that being said, my only public malware on github is basically an old experiment now: almost two years out of date, widely detected and not stealthy. also i've been clear that it's purely for study and learning, not for live use</p>
    <p>so no, it's not a big deal. actual destructive malware is not something i'd deploy. everything i do is under a virtual machine. it's not like i'm the only malware developer on earth and if you're triggered just because you know someone is one you shouldn't even be on the internet anyways</p>
